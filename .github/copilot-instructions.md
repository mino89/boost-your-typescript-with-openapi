I am working on a project that involves using openapi specifications in a Typescript project. I want to ensure that the code generated from the openapi specs is type-safe and integrates well with my existing Typescript codebase.

## Tech Stack
- Typescript
- OpenAPI
- Node.js

## Project structure
- `src/`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/api/`: Contains the generated API client code from OpenAPI specs.
- `src/models/`: Contains the data models used in the application.
- `src/services/`: Contains the business logic and services that interact with the API client.
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.
